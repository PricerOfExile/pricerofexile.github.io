Project description
===================

This is our project proposal to compete in the `Summer Coding Challenge` focusing on artificial intelligence.

Here is the initial pitch :

>This project focuses on analyzing item pricing within the online game Path of Exile, where the in-game market operates without regulation and is entirely driven by the player community. By examining how players set prices and trade items, the project aims to provide insights into the dynamics of this unique, player-controlled economy. Ultimately, the goal is to better understand market trends, pricing strategies, and the factors influencing value within this complex virtual marketplace.
