The modeling phase of this project has been split into three main parts:

1. Data exploration
2. Modeling and training
3. Model exposition

The last part (model exposition) is covered in the [architecture](Components/project_architecture.md) section, and we 
will here focus on the two first parts.

However, a [Base Principles](Components/Model/base_principles.md) will first describe some AI fundamentals that could be
a good refresher (or could be skipped altogether).
